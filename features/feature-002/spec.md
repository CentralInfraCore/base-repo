# Feature Specifications

## Feature-002: Git Management System Development and Administration

### Overview
**Feature-002** focuses on developing and managing the git management system for the project. The goal of this feature is to oversee version control, define all git workflows, and establish rules regarding branches, commits, and merges. All the rules and workflows for branches will be implemented under the **feature-002** branch.

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Git Workflow Design**:
    - Develop a well-defined git workflow for the project.
    - Provide clear guidelines for managing branches and commits.

2. **Branch Naming Conventions**:
    - Introduce a naming convention for branches: **main**, **devel**, **feature**, **release**, and **hotfix**.
    - Main branch names will follow the pattern: `m/`, `d/`, `r-<version>`, `f/feature-<ID>`, `h/hotfix-<ID>`.
    - Features and hotfixes can branch off from the relevant branches and be handled independently from the latest release branch.

3. **Merge Rules for Branches**:
    - Merges into main branches should only occur after all tests have passed.
    - Define rules to synchronize closely related branches and merge changes when necessary.

4. **Commit and Workflow Guidelines**:
    - Define clear commit messages and the rules for committing.
    - Encourage developers to write clear commit messages and ensure that the commits represent logical, incremental changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Security**:
    - Ensure proper security measures for version control, so sensitive code and documentation are protected.

2. **Accessibility**:
    - Ensure the git repository is accessible to all developers and is up-to-date with the latest changes.
    - Branches and commits must be easily accessible, and new versions should be released in a timely manner.

---

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. All git rules and workflows defined under **feature-002** should be properly documented.
2. Developers should be able to follow the version control rules and workflows easily.
3. Commits and merges must follow the project's guidelines.
4. The version control system should be transparent and accessible to all team members.

### Timeline:
- **Start Date**: March 10, 2025
- **End Date**: March 17, 2025

---

### Notes:
- The **feature-002** branch will be maintained and administered continuously to ensure compliance with version control rules.
- All git workflows and branch naming conventions will be developed on this branch.
