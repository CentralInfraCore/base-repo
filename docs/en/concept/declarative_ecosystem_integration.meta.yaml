  This document outlines a blueprint for a declarative, two-speed ecosystem for managing dependencies between
  software components. The system uses a "fast" (commit-level) and a "slow" (release-level) integration process
  to ensure both maximum development speed and system stability simultaneously. The central element is a
  version-controlled "ecosystem map" that defines the relationships between components, enabling automated,
  transparent feedback across the entire system.
