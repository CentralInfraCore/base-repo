  This document outlines a blueprint for a declarative, two-speed ecosystem for managing dependencies between software components. The system uses a "fast" (commit-level) and a "slow" (release-level) integration process to ensure both maximum development speed and system stability simultaneously. The central element is a version-controlled "ecosystem map" that defines the relationships between components, enabling automated, transparent feedback across the entire system.
